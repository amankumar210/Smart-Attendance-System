# Smart-Attendance-System
Face Recognition and GeoFencing based attendance system

NIRMAN HackNation 2022

Problem Statement
It is required to develop a smart attendance capturing mobile app with following features: 
It will recognize the employee/student by face while capturing the attendance (entry) through face recognition and enter the relevant details including entry time in the system after successful face recognition. Similarly, while exiting the office/college premises, employee/student will be recognized using his/her face and exit time will be entered in the system.
The app should automatically capture the GPS location where the attendance is being taken and allow capturing the attendance only in a geo-fenced area (100 meters within LATITUDE/LONGITUDE) the office/college premises. Otherwise, the app will automatically exit.
The app will successfully work for any specific employees with or without wearing spectacles, cap or industrial helmet.




Solution Approach

Developing a Smart Attendance Capturing Mobile App using Face Recognition and Geo-fencing.
User must login at the selected premises.
Location of the user and the face is recognized by matching the data from the database.
Attendance is marked successful if the user's face is matched and he/she must be present on the campus.
Administrator maintains the database of all the Users.
